I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [CSE Department](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk) in the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://hkust.edu.hk), under the supervision of [Prof. Shueng-Han Gary Chan](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~gchan/). I have two Master's degree. I obtained my Master of Science degree (in Information Technology) from HKUST. Prior to that, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree (by research, in Geodesy and Surveying Engineering) from [Wuhan University (WHU)](https://www.whu.edu.cn) under the supervision of Prof. [Caijun Xu](https://www.sgg.whu.edu.cn/info/1424/2093.htm). I received my Bachelor's degree (in Geodesy and Geomatics Engineering) from WHU.

My research focus on the analytics and modeling of `sequential and temporal data` with `deep learning`, for the purpose of both `scientific research` (e.g. earth science and medicine) and `real-world applications` (e.g. healthcare and transportation).
